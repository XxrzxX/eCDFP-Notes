# üõ£Ô∏è RoadMap & My Experience

## My Experience

I'm writing this review to share some essential resources, insights, and tools you'll need for preparation. Plus, I'll include some study notes and free resources for those who can't afford subscription fees. I strongly recommend setting up a home lab to practice Windows forensics and disk forensics.

I recommend using [Blue Cape Security's Practical Windows Forensics Lab](https://github.com/bluecapesecurity/PWF) as it provides a comprehensive guide that will help you build your lab easily, offering step-by-step instructions and practical insights to enhance your understanding of digital forensics. Setting up a well-equipped lab will greatly assist in mastering the process of collecting and analyzing evidence.

Personally, I didn‚Äôt follow the INE course due to the lack of a subscription. Instead, I relied on resources available online, which I have compiled on my GitHub.

## RoadMap üõ£

Here's the path I followed and would suggest to achieve the level required to pass the exam. ‚¨áÔ∏è
